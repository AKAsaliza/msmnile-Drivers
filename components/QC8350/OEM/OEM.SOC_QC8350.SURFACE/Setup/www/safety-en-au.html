  <h2><img alt="" height="24" src="warning.png" width="25">WARNING: Musculoskeletal disorders</h2>
  <p>Use of electronic input devices may be linked  to serious injuries or disorders. When using a computer, as with many  activities, you may experience occasional discomfort in your hands, arms,  shoulders, neck, or other parts of your body. However, if you experience  symptoms such as persistent or recurring discomfort, pain, throbbing, aching,  tingling, numbness, burning sensation, or stiffness, DO NOT IGNORE THESE  WARNING SIGNS. PROMPTLY SEE A QUALIFIED HEALTH PROFESSIONAL, even if symptoms  occur when you are not working at your computer. Symptoms like these can be  associated with painful and sometimes permanently disabling injuries or  disorders of the nerves, muscles, tendons, or other parts of the body.</p>
  <p> These musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) include  carpal tunnel syndrome, tendonitis, tenosynovitis, and other conditions. While  researchers are not yet able to answer many questions about MSDs, there is  general agreement that many factors may be linked to their occurrence, including:  overall health, stress and how one copes with it, medical and physical  conditions, and how a person positions and uses his or her body during work and  other activities (including use of a keyboard or mouse). The amount of time a  person performs an activity may also be a factor.</p>
  <p> Some guidelines that may help you work more  comfortably with your computer and possibly reduce your risk of experiencing an  MSD can be found at <a href="https://support.microsoft.com">support.microsoft.com</a> and <a href="https://xbox.com/xboxone/playhealthy">xbox.com/xboxone/playhealthy</a> (Healthy Gaming Guide). </p>
  <h2><img alt="" height="24" src="warning.png" width="25">WARNING: Photosensitive 
    seizures</h2>
  <p>Some people may experience a seizure when  exposed to flashing lights or patterns in moving images or video games. Even  people who have no history of seizures or epilepsy may have an undiagnosed  condition that can cause &ldquo;photosensitive seizures&rdquo; while watching moving images  or video games. </p>
  <p> These seizures may have a variety of symptoms,  including lightheadedness, altered vision, eye or face twitching, jerking or  shaking of arms or legs, disorientation, confusion, or momentary loss of  awareness. Photosensitive seizures may also cause loss of consciousness or  convulsions that can lead to injury from falling or striking nearby objects.  Immediately stop playing and consult a doctor if you experience any of these  symptoms. Parents should watch for or ask their children about the above  symptoms â€” children and teenagers are more likely than adults to experience  these seizures. The risk of photosensitive seizures may be reduced by taking  the following precautions:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Sit farther from the video screen.</li>
    <li>Use a smaller video screen.</li>
    <li>Play in a well-lit room.</li>
    <li>Do not play when you are drowsy or       fatigued.</li>

  <h2><img alt="" height="24" src="warning.png" width="25"> <img alt="" height="24" src="hearing_warning_symbol.png" width="29"> CAUTION: Hearing safety</h2>
  <p>Frequent or  extended exposure to loud noise or sounds when using a headset or headphones  can cause temporary or permanent hearing loss. Individual susceptibility to  noise-induced hearing loss and potential hearing problems varies. Also, the  sound volume produced by a device may vary depending on the nature of the  sound, device settings, and the headset or headphones used. As a result, there  is no single volume setting that is appropriate for everyone or for every  combination of sound, settings, and equipment. </p>
  <p> Here are a few common-sense recommendations to minimize your  exposure to loud noises or sounds when  using a headset or headphones with your device: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Minimize  your time listening to loud sound. All of the sound you are exposed to each day  adds up. At maximum volume, listening to music or other content on your device  with a headset or headphones can permanently damage your hearing in 15 minutes.  If you are exposed to other loud sounds also, it takes less time listening at  high volumes to cause hearing damage.</li>
    <li>The  more time you spend exposed to loud sounds, the more likely you are to damage  your hearing. The louder the sound, the less time that is required to damage  your hearing. </li>
    <li>Always turn the volume on your device down  before plugging a headset or headphones into your device.  Set the volume loud  enough to hear clearly in quiet surroundings, and no louder. </li>
    <li>Do  not increase the volume after you start listening. Your ears can adapt over  time so that high volume sounds normal, but the high volume could still damage  your hearing. </li>
    <li>Do  not increase the volume to block outside noise. The combination of outside  noise and sound from your headset or headphones can damage your hearing. Sealed  or noise-canceling headphones can reduce outside noise so that you don&rsquo;t have to  turn up the volume. </li>
    <li>If  you can&rsquo;t understand someone nearby speaking normally, turn down the volume.  Sound that drowns out normal speech can damage your hearing. Even with sealed  or noise-canceling headphones, you should be able to hear nearby people speak. </li>
    <li>To  minimize the potential for hearing damage, keep the volume low enough that you  can carry on a conversation with people nearby. </li>
    <li>Headphones  and headsets can attract dangerous objects like staples and paper clips. Always  check your headset or headphones before use.</li>
    <li>Use  of a headset or headphones while driving may be prohibited or restricted in  your area; check your local laws and regulations for further information.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Finally, be  aware of hearing loss symptoms. It&rsquo;s a good idea to have your hearing checked  regularly by an audiologist. Stop using a headset or headphones with your  device and have your hearing checked if:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You  experience any hearing loss symptoms</li>
    <li>You  hear ringing in your ears</li>
    <li>Your  speech sounds muffled, dull, or flat</li>
  </ul>
  <h2><img alt="" height="24" src="warning.png" width="25"> CAUTION: Touch-screen 
    glass</h2>
  <p>The touch screen on your device, like most touch screens, is  made of glass. The glass can break if your device is dropped or receives a  significant impact. To reduce the risk of personal injury, avoid touching the screen  if the glass is broken, chipped or cracked and arrange to have the screen  replaced.Â  </p>
  <p> A cracked or chipped touch screen caused by misuse or abuse of  your device is not covered under the product&rsquo;s limited warranty.</p>
  <h2><img alt="" height="24" src="warning.png" width="25"> CAUTION: Skin irritation</h2>
  <p>This device is made of materials commonly used in wearable
    consumer electronic devices. However, certain people may develop
    skin irritation due to allergies or sensitivities. To reduce the risk of
    skin irritation:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Clean your device regularly.</li>
    <li>Avoid using lotions or other products under the portions of the
      device that contact your skin.</li>
    <li>Use with caution if your skin is irritated or injured.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If symptoms are severe or persist, consult your physician.</p>
  <h2><img alt="" height="24" src="warning.png" width="25"> CAUTION: Navigation </h2>
  <p>The navigation functions and location services on your device rely
    on data services that are subject to change and may not be available
    in all areas or under all conditions. As a result, the map and locationbased
    functions on your device may be unavailable, inaccurate, or
    incomplete. Always use common sense when navigating, compare
    the information provided by navigation functions to what you see in
    your surroundings, and observe existing road conditions and posted
    signs to identify any discrepancies.</p>
  <h2><img alt="" height="24" src="warning.png" width="25"> CAUTION: Cable and cord safety</h2>
  <p>Exposed device cables and cords pose a potential tripping hazard.  Arrange all cables and cords so that people and pets are not likely to trip over or accidentally pull on them as they move around or walk through the area. Do not allow children to play with cables and cords. To avoid damaging the cords and cables:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Protect cords from being walked on or crushed.</li>
    <li> Protect cords from being pinched or sharply bent, particularly where they connect to a wall power (mains) outlet, the power supply unit, and your device. </li>
    <li> Do not jerk, knot, sharply bend, stretch, or otherwise abuse the power cords. Do not wrap your power cord too tightly, especially around the power brick. Instead, wrap it using loose coils rather than tight angles </li>
    <li> Do not expose power cords to heat sources. </li>
    <li> Do not allow pets or children to bite or chew on power cords. </li>
    <li> When disconnecting the power cord, pull on the plugâ€”do not pull on the cord. </li>
    <li>Inspect your power cords regularly.  If a power cord becomes warm, frayed, cracked or damaged in any way, stop using it immediately.  We recommend that you replace your damaged power cord with a genuine Microsoft replacement power cord.<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>NOTICE: Heat related 
    concerns </h2>
  <p>Your device may become very warm during normal use. It complies with the user-accessible
    surface temperature limits defined by the International Standards for Safety (IEC 60950-1 and IEC
    62368). Still, sustained contact with warm surfaces for long periods of time may cause discomfort
    or injury. To reduce potential heat-related concerns, follow these guidelines:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Keep your device and its power adapter in a well-ventilated area when in use or charging.
      Allow for adequate air circulation under and around the device.</li>
    <li>Use common sense to avoid situations where your skin is in contact with your device or its
      power adapter when itâ€™s operating or connected to a power source. For example, donâ€™t sleep
      with your device or its power adapter, or place it under a blanket or pillow, and avoid contact
      between your body and your device when the power adapter is connected to a power source.
      Take special care if you have a physical condition that affects your ability to detect heat against
      the body. </li>
    <li>If your device is used for long periods, its  surface can become very warm. While the temperature may not feel hot to the  touch, if you maintain physical contact with the device for a long time, for  example if you rest the device on your lap, your skin might suffer a low-heat  injury.Â  </li>
    <li>If your device is on your lap and gets  uncomfortably warm, remove it from your lap and place it on a stable work  surface. </li>
    <li>Never place your device or AC adaptor on  furniture or any other surface that might be marred by exposure to heat since  the base of your device and the surface of the AC adaptor may increase in  temperature during normal use. </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>NOTICE: Handling</h2>
  <p>Handle your Microsoft device with care. It is made of metal, glass,
    and plastic and has sensitive electronic components inside. Your

  <h2>Disposal of Waste Batteries and Electrical &amp; Electronic Equipment</h2>
  <p><img alt="WEEE symbol" height="44" src="weee.png" width="28">This symbol on the product or its batteries or its packaging means that this product and any batteries it contains must not be disposed of with your household waste. Instead, it is your responsibility to hand this over to an applicable collection point for the recycling of batteries and electrical and electronic equipment. This separate collection and recycling will help to conserve natural resources and prevent potential negative consequences for human health and the environment due to the possible presence of hazardous substances in batteries and electrical and electronic equipment, which could be caused by inappropriate disposal. For more information about where to recycle
    or dispose of your batteries and used equipment, please check our website at <a href="https://aka.ms/eRecycle">aka.ms/eRecycle</a>, or contact your local city/municipality office, your household waste disposal service, or the shop where you purchased this product. Contact <a href="mailto:eRecycle@microsoft.com">eRecycle@microsoft.com</a> for additional questions. Rechargeable products may contain a Lithium-ion battery.</p>
  <h2>Exposure to Radio Frequency (RF) Energy</h2>
  <p>This device contains radio transmitters and has been designed, manufactured and tested to meet the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Industry Canada, and European guidelines for RF exposure and Specific Absorption Rate. To ensure that your exposure to RF energy generated by the radio transmitters does not exceed the exposure limits set forth by these guidelines, orient the device such that the displays are not directly in contact with your body when in dual screen modes, such as lying the dual displays face down on your lap or upper body. When the device is folded for carrying, it meets FCC and Industry Canada RF exposure guidelines when positioned at least 3/8 of an inch (1.0 cm) away from the body. If a case, holster, or other device accessory is used to carry the device, it should provide at least this much separation distance from the device to the body and should not contain any metal parts in order to remain in compliance with the RF exposure guidelines.</p>
  <p>Product SAR information is available at <a href="https://sar.microsoft.com">sar.microsoft.com</a>. Additional information about RF safety can be found on the
